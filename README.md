# Customer_Churn_prediction_ML-Model
## OBJECTIVE
It is a model that predicts the churn rate of an employee and the impact of various features responsible for this churn. 
## DATASET
 [â€œTelco customer Dataset"](https://github.com/piyushthakur16/Customer_Churn_prediction_ML-Model/blob/main/Telco-Customer-Churn%20Dataset.csv)
 

##  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Python 
 
 
## PROCESS OVERVIEW
- Data were pre-processed and cleaned and then was evaluated using the Ridge classifier and Random Forest Model.
- Obtained accuracy was around 88% with Random Forest.
- Resampling was done to the data to get around 90%  overall accuracy with a Random Forest classifier
- This is the mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator.
- In the previous random forest, the mean score was approximately 88% (90% on training and 86% on test). 
- Using GridSearchCV, we improved the model accuracy by 2%.
